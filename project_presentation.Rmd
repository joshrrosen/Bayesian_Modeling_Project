# Background and Research Question 

- Lightweight micromobility systems, such as dock-to-dock bikeshare and dockless scooters are ubiquitous in a growing number of cities, but the impacts have not been well studied

- Between 2011 and 2014, the Boston metropolitan area launched and began an initial expansion of its first dock-to-dock bikeshare system

- Does the introduction of bikeshare have a (negative) impact on city-level traffic injuries?


# Brief literature review

- [Cloud, Heb, Kasinger (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06870) operationalize the staggered rollout of e-scooters in 93 European cities to a roughly 10% increase in reported traffic accidents after e-scooters were introduced. Effects were largest in cities with limited cycling infrastructure, and no effects were identified in cities with existing infrastructure.

- [Fisherman, Schepers (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437515001024?casa_token=uWyYkv-QeEwAAAAA:bHkCbOBDN8P8eGzc9TXx9hHYNn1N70U65TtPF-jTfCPeM2wWBSPqnnDy3QTcfKaF2xRIrTZQl6o) find that the introduction of a bikeshare system is associated with a reduction in cycling injury risk.

# Data

Aggregated and merged month/city level data for the following variables:

-- Traffic injuries 

-- Aggregate bikeshare trips

Data includes 7 cities: 4 cities that did not receive bikeshares during the treatment period, and 3 cities that received bikeshare (staggered treatment dates)


# Trends

\

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/Pictures/parallel_trends.PNG")
```
\

\end{center}

- Decreasing trend absent of intervention (not quite clear in this plot)

# Previous Empirical Framework

- Goal: identify the causal effect of bikeshare on traffic injuries using bayesian instrumental variables with random effects

# Refresher on Instrumental variables:

\begin{center}
$x_i = \gamma + z_i\delta + \eta_i$

\

$y_i = \alpha + \hat{x_i} \beta + \epsilon_i $
\end{center}

Where the two equations represent the first and second stages respectively. Here, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are intercepts, and $\delta$ and $\beta$ are regression coefficients. We also note that in the second stage, $x_i$ is replaced with $\hat{x_i}$ to indicate the fitted value of our endogenous treatment variable generated by estimating the first stage with instrument $z_i$. Critically, the errors $\eta_i$ and $\epsilon_i$ are correlated, and we are thus unable to only estimate the second stage regression.

# First stage specification

\begin{center}
$Trips_i = \phi + \nu_{0, cm[i]} + \gamma_0 T_i + (\gamma_1 + \nu_{1,m[i]})T_i + (\delta_0 + \nu_{2,c[i]})T_i \times After_i + (\delta_1 + \nu_{3,m[i]})T_i \times After_i$

$\nu_{0, cm[i]} \vert \sigma_{\nu_0} \ \ \ i.i.d \ \ \ N(0, \sigma^2_{\nu_0})$

$\nu_{1, m[i]} \vert \sigma_{\nu_2} \ \ \ i.i.d \ \ \ N(0, \sigma^2_{\nu_2})$

$\nu_{2, c[i]} \vert \sigma_{\nu_3} \ \ \ i.i.d \ \ \ N(0, \sigma^2_{\nu_3})$

$\nu_{3, c[i]} \vert \sigma_{\nu_1} \ \ \ i.i.d \ \ \ N(0, \sigma^2_{\nu_4})$

\end{center}

- Where $\nu_{c[i]}$ and $\nu_{m[i]}$ allow the relationship between $T_i$ and $T_i \times After_i$ to vary by city-level and month-level, respectively

# Second stage specification

\hfill(6)

\begin{center}
$y_{i} = \alpha + \eta_{0, mc[i]} + (\beta_1 + \eta_{1,c[i]})Trips_i + (\beta_2 + \eta_{2,m[1]})Trips_i$

$\eta_{0, cm[i]} \vert \sigma_{\eta_0} \ \ \ i.i.d \ \ \ N(0, \sigma^2_{\eta_0})$

$\eta_{1, c[i]} \vert \sigma_{\eta_1} \ \ \ i.i.d \ \ \ N(0, \sigma^2_{\eta_1})$

$\eta_{2, m[i]} \vert \sigma_{\eta_2} \ \ \ i.i.d \ \ \ N(0, \sigma^2_{\eta_2})$
\end{center}

- Goal: capture city-specific $\eta_{1, c[i]}$ and month-specific $n_{2, m[i]}$ deviations in the relationship between the instrumented total bike trips and the outcome variable total traffic injuries  

# Current Empirical Framework

- Updated Goal: Utilize seasonal ARIMA for Bayesian time series 

- Compare the predicted traffic injuries post bikeshare introduction to the observed traffic injuries. If no other conditions change at intervention point $t_i$, then we can attribute the forecast error to be the causal effect of bikeshare on traffic injuries.

- Forecast error: the difference between an observed value and its forecast (measured using MAE, RMSE, etc.)

\begin{center}

$e_{j, T+h} = y_{T+h} - \hat{y}_{T+h | T} $

\end{center}

# Reference Materials 

- Largely relying on the 'bayesforecast' library in R
- 'bayesforecast' allows users to fit Bayesian time series models using (r)stan for full Bayesian inference


# Methods matter!

- ARIMA vs. Non-ARIMA

```

\

\end{center}


# Data (ctd)

- A look at Cambridge data

- 60 months (5 years); 30 months before and after intervention

\begin{center}

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "175px"}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/Pictures/seasonal1.PNG")
```
\

\end{center}

- Interestingly, here there is no clear seasonal trend (before or after treatment)

# Data (ctd)

```

Correlogram: Autocorrelation Function

\end{center}

- Plotting the autocorrelation function $r_k$ indicates that that monthly variation in traffic injuries is essentially random and is uncorrelated with previous months
- No trend or seasonality: this is white noise (stationary), so timing is predictable

# Simple specification

Naive model / Random walk (forecast is equal to the last observed value):

\begin{center}

$\epsilon_{j,t} = y_{j, t} - \hat{y}_{j,t}$ 

where $\hat{y}_{j,t} = y_{j,t-1} $ 

and $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$

\end{center}



# ARIMA specification

- Seasonal ARIMA model

\begin{center}

General model: $ARIMA(p,d,q)(P, D, Q)s$

\end{center}

- We might estimate a model:

\begin{center}

$y_{j,t} = c + \phi_1y_{j,t-1} + \ ... \ + \phi_{j,t-p} + \ ... \ + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{j,t-1} + \ ... \ + \theta_q \varepsilon_{j,t-q} + \varepsilon_{j,t}$

\end{center}

# Next Steps

- Set priors
- Set ARIMA parameters 
- Dive into hierarchical time series
